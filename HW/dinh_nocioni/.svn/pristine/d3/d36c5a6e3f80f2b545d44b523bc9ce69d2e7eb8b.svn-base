synopsis~: Let's rework the test

details: 

-play with correct spelling


Let's focus on the test mentioned in tests.txt.

-play with correct spelling
For this test we will pass "FAVOR" for target and "FAVOR" for guess to play, with attempt 0. The play will access a mock that will return true for is_spelling_correct("FAVOR"). The play will then return a response of all EXACT, attempts = 1, status of WIN, etc. The test should check that the mock was called with FAVOR.

synopsis~: just one test to see the direction we are taking

details: 

Not five, just one test, only one single test. We write a test, minimum code, so we can see if we are in the right direction or we need to change.

Please place only one test in tests.txt, please implement that one test minimally (no parametrization for that), and absolutely minimum code for that one test.

Let's do a quick review after these changes. Please modify the requestReview.txt file and check it in as soon as you are ready and I will do a review well before the next scheduled review cycle.
