synopsis: let's bring in the details

details: 


Please spellcheck.

1.
The first paragraph missed out the point that the author discusses two separate approaches, the planned design and evolutionary design. Need to step back and bring out the focus on the comparison the author makes before we dive in.

Patterns instead of pattern.

Instead of second, next, etc. let the ideas flow without such numbering.

Let's re-read the article and bring out several interesting and useful thoughts from it.

Let's bring in the details here in part 1.

2.

Please state name here and write your part under your name. Let's write in short paragraphs, to bring out multiple observations.

synopsis: let's restructure

details: 

1.
No name here in this part. One combined response. Please do not make this bullets with First, second. Instead, please write in multiple short paragraphs, where each paragraphs focuses on one idea, concept, or thoughts. Start with a short introductory paragraph, then multiple paragraphs, and then a summary or conclusion paragraph.

Please read the article, then create a narrative arc to bring the details with good flow.
