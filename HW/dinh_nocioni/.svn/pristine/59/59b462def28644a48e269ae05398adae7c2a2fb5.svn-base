synopsis~: let's start with a canary test

details: 

Let's start with a canary test - assert true is true.

Please write code in appropriate files with proper language baed extensions.

In tests.txt only list the tests, one line at a time. No code, no additional details in that file.

Let us write the canary test and may be one more test, minimum code for that one test, and then do a quick review.

Let's do a quick review after these changes. Please modify the requestReview.txt file and check it in as soon as you are ready and I will do a review well before the next scheduled review cycle.
