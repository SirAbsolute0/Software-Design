synopsis~: please remove radonui

details: 

Please remove radon ui task. Please leave the radon task as is to run through the complexity of code in src.

After entering RIVER, hit enter. Nothing happened. Both enter and press of the Guess button should have the same effect.

Let's take the first small step for the new features. One test and miniumum code for it.

synopsis~: a few things to improve

details: 

When the UI pops up, we need to see a Guess button that is disabled. When a row is filled let the button be enabled.

Please do not exclude UI from radon.

Let's do a quick review after these changes. Please modify the requestReview.txt file and check it in as soon as you are ready and I will do a review well before the next scheduled review cycle.
