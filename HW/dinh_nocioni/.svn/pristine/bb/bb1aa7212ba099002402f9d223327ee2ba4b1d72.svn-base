xprice when no vendors are available
xprice for one day rental when one vendor is available

xprice for three days rental when one vendor is available

xprice for one day when three vendors are available, third with better price

xprice for one day when three vendors are available, first one fails request, second has better price

xprice for one day when three vendors are available, all failing request

Dynamic Discovery:
#Feedback: we have designed the core functionality to get the lower price details from different vendors.
#Next step, we want to discover different vendors that are available during runtime.
#Let's think of how we can design that. We want this to be dynamic, if we create new vendors, we don't want to change any code, but
#when the program is run, it will give us all the vendors that are available. Let's focus on designing a function that will return
#to us all the vendors (functions of course) that are available.
