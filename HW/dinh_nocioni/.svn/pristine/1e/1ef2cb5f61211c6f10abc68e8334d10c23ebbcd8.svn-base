synopsis: good so far

details: 

Good so far. Please see suggestions in files.

Let's incrementally create a GUI at this time.
Please create a build task to display the GUI from the build automation:
When 
paver
is run, execute the tests.

when
paver ui
is run, execute the GUI

Let's take small steps here and review frequently.

Please exclude the UI code from test coverage.

Display six rows with the first row enabled. Guess button should be disabled.

Need the ability to type a word and have it appear in the first row. Then pressing the Guess button should show the color coded response and enable the next row.

synopsis~: let's take the next step

details: 

 Nice work on taking the next step. We will rework the design a bit.
 -play first attempt with winning guess
  We will design a play function so it takes three parameters:
  1. A target
  2. A guess
  3. Number of the attempt
  
  It will return the number of attempts so far, array/list of Responses, game status (win, loss, or in progress), and message for the win, loss, or empty

For this first test we will call play("FAVOR", "FAVOR", 0)
The response should be:
1 for number of attempts
[EXACT, EXACT, EXACT, EXACT, EXACT] for response
WIN for game status
"Amazing" for the message

synopsis: let's proceed to the next step

details: 

Let's think of the next step. Please don't write a lot of code at this point. Write one test and minimum code for that next step. Then ask for a review. We can see if we are heading in a good direction and if so we can then proceed. Otherwise, we can change direction more easily without having written too much code. Please remember to list the test for the next step in tests.txt.

Please remember, one test (just one), and as minimum code as possible, so we can see if this is a direction we want to go or change.

synopsis: functional style approach

details: 

Here is a pseudocode for the problem, using functional style and without any explicit mutation:

tally(target, guess) {
  return guess.split('')
    .reduce((response, letter, i) => response append tallyForPosition(i, target, guess), []);
}

function tallyForPosition(position, target, guess) {
  if(target[position] === guess[position]) {
    return EXACT;
  }
  
  letterAtPosition = guess[position];

  positionalMatches = countPositionalMatches(target, guess, letterAtPosition);
  nonPositionalOccurrencesInTarget = countNumberOfOccurrenceeUntilPosition(WORD_SIZE - 1, target, letterAtPosition) - positionalMatches;
    
  numberOfOccurancesInGuessUntilPosition = countNumberOfOccurrenceeUntilPosition(position, guess, letterAtPosition);
    
  if(nonPositionalOccurrencesInTarget >= numberOfOccurancesInGuessUntilPosition) {
    return EXISTS;
  }
    
  return NO_MATCH;
}

function countPositionalMatches(target, guess, letter) {
  return target.split('')
    .filter((ch, i) => target[i] === guess[i])
    .filter(ch => ch === letter)
    .length;
}

function countNumberOfOccurrenceeUntilPosition(position, word, letter) {
  matches = word.substring(0, position + 1).match(new RegExp(letter, 'g'));
  
  return matches ? matches.length : 0;
}


Hope that helps.

A CI build has been setup for your project.
You can see files related to this under assign1.

How does this work?
When you check in code, the CI build machine wakes up, fetches the latest 
version of your code, and runs the file build.sh that is under your repository (above assign1). That file in turn runs the build scripts in your assign1 directory.

In case you missed it, please read:
<https://groups.google.com/g/uhcss23sd/c/2zkxY4s_-C4/m/feookVEEAQAJ>

Also, please keep an eye on code coverage. To view the code coverage, please 
run the build using the following command (do not click or double click, 
instead open the command prompt, cd to your assign1 directory, and then run 
from there).
