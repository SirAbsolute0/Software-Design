synopsis~: let's get the directory structure in place

details: 

Please delete test_.py.

Please see tests.txt for some tests to write.

A CI build has been setup for your project.
You can see files related to this under assign1.

How does this work?
When you check in code, the CI build machine wakes up, fetches the latest 
version of your code, and runs the file build.sh that is under your repository (above assign1). That file in turn runs the build scripts in your assign1 directory.

In case you missed it, please read:
<https://groups.google.com/g/uhcss23sd/c/2zkxY4s_-C4/m/feookVEEAQAJ>

Also, please keep an eye on code coverage. To view the code coverage, please 
run the build using the following command (do not click or double click, 
instead open the command prompt, cd to your assign1 directory, and then run 
from there).

synopsis~: let's start with a canary test

details: 

Let's start with a canary test - assert true is true.

Please write code in appropriate files with proper language baed extensions.

In tests.txt only list the tests, one line at a time. No code, no additional details in that file.

Let us write the canary test and may be one more test, minimum code for that one test, and then do a quick review.
