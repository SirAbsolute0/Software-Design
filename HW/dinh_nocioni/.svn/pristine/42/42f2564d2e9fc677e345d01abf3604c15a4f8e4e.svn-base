#Feedback: let's pass an additional argument to play. Let that argument be a lambda that takes a 
#word and returns true. In the test, after call to play, let us verify that the lambda was called.
#in the declaration of the play function, let us make this new last parameter as a default parameter
#with a lambda that takes a word and returns true.

#within the test

#   is_spelling_correct.called_with = word
#   return True
#
#call play with "FAVOR", "FAVOR", 0, is_spelling_correct
#
#then verify the result of play is as expected
#then assert that is_spelling_correct.called_with is equal to "FAVOR"
