Please keep all files related to a homework or an assignment within the appropriate directory. Files checked in outside of specific homework or assignment directory will not be reviewed or graded for that homework/assignment.

Check in and modify files as many times as you like. You will not be able to modify the files after the deadline.

You will work as a pair, both of you are responsible for the completed work in all assignments and homework. Reasonable effort is expected from each person. If you do not check in, you will not receive any scores. When pairing please switch who checks in so there is significant number of check in from each of you.

The deadlines are strict, there will be no extensions. Don't email any code to Venkat or to the mailing list. Your last check in before the deadline will be graded. If your last check in breaks the code, both you and your pair will lose significant points.

Please feel free to ask for frequent reviews. See the reviews/readme.txt file for details on how to ask for reviews.

You can evolve the answers and solutions based on the reviews. Only the latest checkin at the time of review will be looked at. Also the final check in will be the only one graded.

You are still responsible to successfully complete an homework or assignment even if your pair is a no-show. You can request to change pairs at any time and if there is another person in the class willing to pair with you we can make the switch.

A lot of help will be provided in this course, but you have to start early and ask for help along the way.                                                                      

Please read the academic honesty policy posted on the course mailing list.                   

The above details apply to all homework and assignments in this course.                   

Now to homework #1.

Is design dead according to Martin Fowler in 
<http://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html>?

Q1. What are some of the main observations he makes about how we should design?

	From the article "Is Design Dead?", the author, Martin Fowler, discusses about the rising of Extreme Programming (XP) practices which could signifiantly affect the future view of design in software development. Based on XP practices, Martin points out four key observations on how we as programmer should do design. These four key obersavations are effective design pattern, understanding the design architecture, utilization of diagrams, and rapid spotting.

	According to Martin, effective design pattern means we understand the price of a pattern worth paying. Specifically, we need to be more familiar with how to ease into a pattern gradually. Effective usage of pattern will simplify future refractoring since many patterns can be traced back to GOF for reference. Some advices for improving pattern utilization are investing time in learning about patterns, concentrate on when to apply pattern and how to apply pattern in simplest form, and finally don't be afraid to remove pattern.

	The second key observation is understanding the design architecture. The author suggests starting by accessing what the likely architecture is, but be ready to simplify the architecture as soon as a part of the architecture isn't adding anything. This will give a general guideline of work but also leaves room for improvement for later in the future.

	Next is the usage of diagrams in the design phase. As desingers we should keep in mind what the drawing diagrams are for. Furthermore, only draw things that are neccessary to communicate the right message. Diagrams can also be a useful tool to explore a design before coding. Diagram is best located where everyone can easilty access, and if no one is using them, throw them away.

	Lastly, rapid spotting is important for design since it means that you have to set things up so that potential problematic areas are rapidly tested. Rapid spotting helps identifying issues along development. It also means that it is worth doing experiments to see how hard future changes can be.

	In summary, while the new rise of XP development practices seem to be opposing traditional designing practices, Martin conclude that it will not entirely replace designing. Furthermore, there are several designing practices such as effectice desgin pattern, understanding design architecture, utilization of diagrams, and rapid spotting that XP developers can take into consideration to develop a better well-rounded software.

Q2. Relate these recommendations to your personal experiences, where it may have 
worked or may not have worked for you.

	Personally, as an undergraduate student, a lot of my programming experiences are coming from Computer Science courses within the university. Within these courses, I usually am developing software prototype rather then a full software with a development cycle. Thus, I have never considered taking a careful look at the design phase before coding. Thus, I would say that I am leanning more toward the XP development side right now. Out of the four key observations from Martin Fowler, I have only utilized rapid spotting and digarams. For rapid spotting, it is to use unit testing to detect problems with my code. For diagrams, it was to line out layout for a database. I have yet to utilized design patterns and design architecture.
